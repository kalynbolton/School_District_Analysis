# School District Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to find specfic school data for Thomas High School ninth grade math and reading scores. Since there were signs of academic dishonesty in their ninth grade class, we refactored the data to not include ninth graders test scores for reading and math and then repeated the analysis of their data, so we could return the analysis to the school board all clean.
## Results
The district summary was affected by just a few decimal points.
